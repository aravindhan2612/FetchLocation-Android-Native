A sample Android app to demonstrate how to fetch device location in the background using foreground services, WorkManager, and broadcast receivers.

## 🚀 Features

- Retrieves location updates even when the app is in the background
- Uses **Foreground Service** for continuous tracking
- **WorkManager** to schedule background location sync tasks
- **BroadcastReceiver** to listen for system or custom intents

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Libraries**:
